# Unreal-Quingine-3D
A 3D engine, in java, made from scratch.

This 3D engine uses Quaternions to determine points in space.
However, due to quite limited knowledge of everything,
this code is poorly optimized.

If downloaded you may notice a terrible naming scheme.
Deal with it. Unless you don't want to.

CHANGES TO COME!
-Distance scaling
-Quicture Matrix Fix (wonky objects)
-Better Qulane z-order (planes sometimes draw in wrong order)
-Math optimizations
-Camera movement
-Texture binding to planes
-Antialiasing
-3D sphere
-Lighting
-Pain

Take this code if you want. I don't care
