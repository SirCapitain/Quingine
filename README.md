# Unreal-Quingine-3D
A 3D engine, in java, made from scratch.

This 3D engine uses Quaternions to determine points in space.
However, due to quite limited knowledge of everything,
this code is poorly optimized.

*PLEASE NOTE*
This program is 100% CPU based. I could install a library to
make it run on a GPU buuuuuut.... I do wanna.

If downloaded you may notice a terrible naming scheme.
Deal with it. Unless you don't want to.

*HOW TO USE*
Open this project in a java coding software. To make your first 3D object your first need to make a Quindow.
After you made a Quindow you need to add a Quicture to it so it can draw stuff. Next, you make a Quworld that will contain the 3D objects.
After that, you add any of the 3D objects available to the Quworld.

*3D Objects Available*
-Qulane (Plane)
-Quectangular Quism (Rectangular Prism)
-Qube (Cube)
-Quiangular Quism (Triangular Prism)
-Qyriamid (Pyriamid)

CHANGES TO COME!
-Better Qulane z-order (planes sometimes draw in wrong order)
-Math optimizations
-Camera movement
-Texture binding to planes
-Antialiasing
-3D sphere
-Lighting
-Even worst name scheme
-Pain

Take this code if you want. I don't care
